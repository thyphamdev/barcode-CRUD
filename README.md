## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# Spin up elasticsearch
docker-compose up

# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev
```

## Still on going
The implementation of /suggestion endpoint is still ongoing. My idea is to use ngram search from ElasticSearch to do the job.
